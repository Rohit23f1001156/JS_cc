<!-- 

default js:
- synchronous
- single threaded

execution context:
- one line of code at a time
- each opn wait for the last one to complete before executing

Blocking code:
- Blocks the flow of program
- eg read file sync
- hindi: aap kuch nhi kr skte jb tk ek kaam ho nhi jaat jaise, jb tk mai paani laata hu tb tk aap kuch aur nhi kr skte(like phone dekhna)

Non Blocking Code:
- does not block the execution
- read file async
- hindi : jb tk mai paani leke ata hu tb tk aap kuch aur kr skte hai.

which is better? - it is based on use cases
