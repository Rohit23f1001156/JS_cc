<!-- 
JS is a synchronously run language, but there are some exceptions

event listners are better than onclick as they give also the ability of propogation

onclick usage:
document.getelementbyId('owl').onclick = function(){
    alert("owl clicked")            -- not prefered in modern times

}

other methods: 
attachEvent()
jQuery - on

** right now best -> addEventListner:

document.getElementById ('owl').addEventListener("click", function(e){cl(e)}, false) 
--- the third parameter is false as default,
------these are the things that I need to learn
---- type, timestamp, preventDefault, target, toElement, srcelement, currentTarget
--clientX,clientY,screenX,screenY
--altkey, ctrkey, shiftkey, keycode
 
now propogation got two parts: event bubbling, event capturing
in bubbling -> goes from inside to outside -> happens as default (since false is default)
capturing -> out to in -> happens when set to true

now if we want to stop propagation, that is when we click on owl, we dont need the clicked ul part
so we do -> e.stopPropagation()
