<!-- 
DOM - DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL

in web browser:

window -> document -> html
html two parts : head, body
head : title -> text node, meta -> attribute

document.getElementBYId("whatever-you-want-to-find").innerHTML = "<h1>R8</h1>"  
so using this you can edit the web page
to know the class of the element we use : "className" not class -> returns undefined
setAttribute always overwrites
so lets say we use:
document.getElementBYId("whatever-you-want-to-find").setAttribute('class', 'test')
if previously it was "heading" now it becomes "test"
but we did not want to delete heading from there, so what we should do is write it as:
setAttribute('class', 'test heading')

inner text will only show what is visible
text content will show whole content, even though it is not visible due to css
innerhtml : gives even the attributes inside the tag

document.querySelector ('h2')
gives the first h2 tag
